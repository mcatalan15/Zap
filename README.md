# ⚡ Zap DEX (WIP)

> **Heads up!** 🚧 This project is actively under development. Things might be messy, broken, or change completely. I'm building a DEX from the ground up!

A minimal, no-frills decentralized exchange for **Ethereum**, powered by a TypeScript frontend and a Go backend.

## 🛠️ Current State

**Right now, it's Ethereum-only.** I'm focusing on making the core swap mechanics rock-solid before expanding elsewhere.

**Built with:**
- **Frontend:** TypeScript
- **Backend/Chain Stuff:** Go, Solidity smart contracts
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum
